Hacker News
================

Started as a project to play with Square's [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library, ended up making a daily driver for reading hacker news.

Uses [cheeaun's](http://cheeaun.com/) [node-hnapi](https://github.com/cheeaun/node-hnapi/) project for it's API backend.
