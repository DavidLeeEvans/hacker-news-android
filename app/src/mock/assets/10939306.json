The hard, and borderline philosophical, part is to identify the proper reference class, i.e., what <i>qualitatively</i> different sorts of observations might have also considered evidence for planet nine, and how many other astrophysical searches are we running that might have given us weird results?  This is really where frequentist approaches strain to be useful, and it&#x27;s hard to avoid resorting to a Bayesian prior.<p>Analogously for particle physics, it&#x27;s easy to compute the chance of getting a 4-sigma deviation for two different experiments in any gamma-gamma energy bins, so the after-the-fact corrections to the significant of a fluctuation in a <i>particular</i> bin are easy to compute.  Much more difficult is to consider all the hundreds of parallel searches going on, of greatly varying levels of motivation, and correcting based on that.",

Could the confinement of the orbits be due to an observational bias or a mere coincidence (after all, we are talking about six objects here - not exactly âbig dataâ)? Thankfully, the probability of the observed alignment being fortuitous can be assessed in a statistically rigorous manner, and clocks in at right around 0.007%. Not a great gamble. Moreover, application of simple perturbation theory (or direct numerical integration) demonstrates that if allowed to evolve under the gravitational influence of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the orbits would become randomly oriented on timescales much shorter than than the multi-billion year lifetime of the solar system. So the dynamical origin of the peculiar structure of the Kuiper belt cannot be outsourced to the distant past - something is holding the orbits together <i>right now</i>.&quot;",

The planets we can see with the naked eye are at most 11AU from us (Saturn is at 10AU at aphelion).<p>For comparison, Neptune is never closer than about 29AU to us.  Brightness goes down as the square of the distance.  But it gets worse, because that&#x27;s brightness at given source brightness.  Planets don&#x27;t radiate intrinsically; they reflect sunlight.  And sunlight brightness drops off as the square of distance from the sun.  Which is to say that even if they were the same size and albedo (they&#x27;re not), Neptune would appear about 81 times dimmer than Saturn to us.  Oh, also (linear) angular size goes down linearly with distance.  So if you want to see the two planets as disks of the same size, you need to have a field of view three times narrower, which means you need 9 times as many of them to cover the sky.  And if you want the same amount of light gathered, you have to spend 81 times longer gathering it, per the above brightness calculation.<p>All of which is to say that the time needed to do an &quot;equivalent&quot; sky survey N times further away (within the solar system, where all the illumination is coming from the sun) scales as N^6.  And planets do move, so you might still miss one if you survey a place where it&#x27;s not yet, then take a while to get to where it used to be, such that it has moved.  This is why Neptune was found via its gravitational interactions followed by a survey of a small part of the sky, not brute-force observation.<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, the proposed Planet Nine orbits 20 times farther out than Neptune.  20^6 is 64 million.  So if we assume we&#x27;ve pretty much surveyed everything out to the radius of Neptune&#x27;s orbit at some resolution, and then spent about 64000 times as much time surveying stuff out to the distance Planet Nine is proposed to be at, at the same resolution (I doubt we have), then we&#x27;ve probably surveyed about 0.1% of the stuff out there.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you what the actual number is, unfortunately, but I suspect the answer is we haven&#x27;t really done very good systematic surveys out at that distance.",

Unfortunately detecting these very distant objects is very difficult.  The light we see from them is reflected light from the Sun, so their apparent brightness goes as 1&#x2F;r^4, not 1&#x2F;r^2 like most objects.  And because they are so close, there is a strong parallax from the motion of the Earth.  THe consequence from this is that the object will actually drift across the image as you are taking it, smearing it out.  In order to detect it you either have to take very short images so that it doesn&#x27;t move too much (in which case you don&#x27;t get very much light), or have some idea as to the direction of the smear so that you can correct for it.  Either way it&#x27;s a very hard observation to make!  Fortunately if this planet is as big as they claim it to be it should be relatively easy to detect compared to Sedna and the other Kuiper Belt objects.",

Used to be the way it was done you would point a telescope at the part of the sky directly opposite the sun (min r^4 so best chance of detection), expose a photographic plate, and repeat a few hours later. Develop the plates, mount them in a blink comparator [1] and scan manually, flipping back and forth between the plates for ~3 hours to look for anything that moved. Exclude false positives like plate blemishes (aka Eastman-Kodak Objects) or dust grains. If you see something, and it is smeared indicating motion during the exposure, mark it as a possible candidate. Revisit the same patch of sky the next night, search again. Use the datapoints to extrapolate forward, check again a couple of weeks later. If you haven&#x27;t lost it (which frequently happened if it was at the limit of visibility), extrapolate back to the previous opposition (~4 years for a main belt asteroid) and search the archives for a match. If you get one, then extrapolate further back and check all previous oppositions. If you get a match on three separate oppositions, congratulations, you have a discovery.<p>Vastly different now - a single observation can net large numbers of asteroids and sensitivity is so much better. Still the search for this potential new planet is definitely going to be daunting given the distance.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blink_comparator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blink_comparator</a>",
